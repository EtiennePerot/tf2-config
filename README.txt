Hey, read this. I know you hate reading READMEs so I'm going to keep this one short.

- Extract or git clone this into "steamapps/common/team fortress 2/tf/custom/wind_config" or something,
  such that you have "steamapps/common/team fortress 2/tf/custom/wind_config/cfg".

- Have a look at "steamapps/common/team fortress 2/tf/custom/wind_config/preferences.cfg".
  You can edit this file to adjust your preferences.

- Extract this to [SteamInstallDir]\steamapps\[User]\team fortress 2, where [SteamInstallDir] is
  Steam's installation directory, and [User] is your Steam username. It should ask about merging

- Have a look at [SteamInstallDir]\steamapps\[User]\team fortress 2\tf\cfg\preferences.cfg.
  You can edit this file to adjust your preferences.

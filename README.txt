Hey, read this. I know you hate reading READMEs so I'm going to keep this one short.

- Copy the "wind_config" folder and its contents to [SteamInstallDir]\steamapps\common\team 
  fortress 2\tf\custom (ensuring that custom\wind_config\cfg is created),
  where [SteamInstallDir] is Steam's installation directory.

- Have a look at [SteamInstallDir]\steamapps\common\team fortress 2\tf\custom\cfg\preferences.cfg.
  You can edit this file to adjust your preferences.
